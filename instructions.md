### Welcome to my application
This application is based on the course project of statistical inference class of the data science specialisation.

In this project, we are using data from world bank, it used data about the United States of America from 1960 to 2012, and what this is actually obtaining for us is the fertility rate of the US between these two dates.

### Input
In this application, user can select date range from 1960 to 2012. user can use slider to select the months for forcast.

The user can can remove certain series from the visualization by selecting it, so if user don't want to see the confidence level anymore, he could remove that.

### Output
Attractive interactive chart is shwoing the time series data, and then used a forecast function to forecast forward three years. As you hover over, you have some information, you have the fertility rate after that specific point in time.It also has some additional information in the tool tip.
